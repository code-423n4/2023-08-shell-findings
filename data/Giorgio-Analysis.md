This audited codebase is relatively compact but is mathematically intensive, involving complex calculations and utility functions. I'm appreciative of the opportunity to review an Automated Market Maker (AMM) for the first time. 

Readability: The code is mostly well-commented but should be updated to clarify that k=1 in the context of evolving Proteus.

Edge Cases: While the protocol is designed not to support pools with two ERC20 tokens that hold close values (e.g., DAI and USDC) or values that are vastly different (e.g., SHIB and BTC), this is not explicitly documented. Further documentation would enhance readability and user understanding.

Typos and Inconsistencies: Minor typos and inconsistencies in the README and comments could lead to misunderstandings and should be rectified.
