## For contextualizing my finding 
Keep in mind that the protocol must charge fees only once per swap/deposit or any other activity, why a user pay fees twice and receive less tokens and if this is told to the users that fees is applied twice then he/she might not use the protocol. Fees are applied so that the pools remain in beneficial position but it should not be at the cost of users receiving less tokens. Other finding(QA report) is pretty much straighforward.
## Approach taken
!. Understand the variables,key terms and key functions and the math behind it 
2. First get familiar with the code and then hunt for bug and repeat it until contest ends.
## Architecture recommendations
Be clear with the maths used and also give a overview of the ABDK library used
## Codebase Quality Analysis
Very well written code
## Centralization risks
No risks
