## No need of if else condition in _getUtility function 
In the line https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-shell/blob/c61cf0e01bada04c3d6055acb81f61955ed600aa/src/proteus/EvolvingProteus.sol#L720

if(a < 0 && b < 0) utility = (r0 > r1) ? r1 : r0;
        else utility = (r0 > r1) ? r0 : r1;
this if condition can be omitted as a and b will always be positive as a and b are calculated as follows  a=sqrt(1/p_max_current)

b = sqrt(p_min_current) which will always give positive value
Can directly use utility = (r0 > r1) ? r0 : r1; and if utility will be negative it will automatically revert in the next line which is 
if (utility < 0) revert CurveError(utility);
 ## Clearly mention the math involved in the function t

/**
       @notice Calculates the time as a percent of total duration
       @param self config instance
    */
    function t(Config storage self) public view returns (int128) {
        return elapsed(self).divu(duration(self));
    }

from above it may be interpretted wrong that t is in percentage which is in the range of 0-100 to be more specific in the range of 0-1 but here due to ABDK math it is not properly in percentage as there is bit shifting being applied due to which the returned number is very big then it is used in other functions as you can see from one given below   
function p_min(Config storage self) public view returns (int128) {
        if (t(self) > ABDK_ONE) return self.px_final;
        else return self.px_init.mul(ABDK_ONE.sub(t(self))).add(self.px_final.mul(t(self)));
    }
   so here t is subtracted from ABDK_ONE which is a large number so clearly the percentage definiton can be miss interpretted.

## Natspec info about a variable doesn't correctly interprets the correct value of the constant BASE_FEE 
/** 
     @notice 
     Equivalent to roughly twenty-five basis points since fee is applied twice.
    */
    uint256 public constant BASE_FEE = 800;
in comments it is written that 25 basis points but base_fee is declared with 800 basis points
