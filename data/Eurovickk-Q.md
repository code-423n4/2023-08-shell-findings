1)Repeating Logic: Some parts of the logic are repeated across functions, like the validation of amounts against INT_MAX and balance checks. Consider consolidating these checks into helper functions to avoid code duplication.

2)Input Validation: The functions validate that the provided amounts and balances are below INT_MAX, but it might be more practical to consider using the actual token decimals and converting amounts into appropriate units.

// Define the token decimals for X and Y tokens
uint8 constant X_TOKEN_DECIMALS = 18; // Adjust as needed
uint8 constant Y_TOKEN_DECIMALS = 18; // Adjust as needed

function swapGivenOutputAmount(
    uint256 xBalance,
    uint256 yBalance,
    uint256 outputAmount,
    SpecifiedToken outputToken
) external view returns (uint256 inputAmount) {
    // Convert outputAmount to token decimal units
    outputAmount = outputAmount * (10 ** (outputToken == SpecifiedToken.X ? X_TOKEN_DECIMALS : Y_TOKEN_DECIMALS));

    // Perform the same validations
    require(outputAmount < INT_MAX);
    _checkAmountWithBalance(
        outputToken == SpecifiedToken.X ? xBalance : yBalance,
        outputAmount
    );

    // Rest of the function remains unchanged
    int256 result = _swap(
        FEE_UP,
        -int256(outputAmount),
        int256(xBalance),
        int256(yBalance),
        outputToken
    );

    require(result > 0);
    inputAmount = uint256(result);

    _checkAmountWithBalance(
        outputToken == SpecifiedToken.X ? yBalance : xBalance,
        inputAmount
    );
}

// Similar changes can be applied to other functions as well

In this example, we've assumed that both X and Y tokens have 18 decimals, but you should adjust X_TOKEN_DECIMALS and Y_TOKEN_DECIMALS to match the actual decimal values of your tokens. By converting the input values to appropriate decimal units, you can perform more meaningful comparisons and calculations, while also reducing the risk of running into integer overflow issues when dealing with large amounts.
