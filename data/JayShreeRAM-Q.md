##  1: Incorrect Parameter Order in Constructor

In the constructor of the EvolvingProteus contract, the parameters py_init and px_init are swapped when being passed to the LibConfig.newConfig function. This will cause the initial prices to be incorrectly assigned to the wrong axes, leading to unexpected behavior in the curve calculations.

##  2: Incorrect Utility Calculation

In the _getUtility function, there is an issue with the quadratic equation calculation to find the utility. The calculation involves converting values to ABDKMath64x64 fixed-point representation, and this conversion is done incorrectly, resulting in incorrect utility values being computed. This can lead to incorrect decisions in various parts of the contract that rely on utility calculations.

## 3: Missing Return Statement in _getPointGivenXandUtility and _getPointGivenYandUtility

In the _getPointGivenXandUtility and _getPointGivenYandUtility functions, there is a missing return statement at the end of the functions. This will cause the functions to not return any values, leading to unpredictable behavior when these functions are called.

## 4: Incorrect Balance Checks in _lpTokenSpecified

In the _lpTokenSpecified function, when calculating the final price points, the balance checks are performed incorrectly. Instead of checking the computed balances against the specified balances, the code checks the computed balances against the input balances. This will result in incorrect validation of the final balances after a deposit or withdrawal.

## 5: Incorrect Balances Validation in _swap

In the _swap function, the validation of balances after the swap is performed using incorrect formulas. The formulas used to calculate the computed amounts are incorrect and do not take into account the direction of the swap and fee adjustments. This will lead to incorrect validation of balances after a swap operation.

## 6: Incorrect Conditions in BoundaryError

In the _checkBalances function, the conditions to check the final balance ratio are incorrect. Instead of using finalBalanceRatio < MIN_M and MAX_M <= finalBalanceRatio, it should be finalBalanceRatio <= MIN_M and MAX_M < finalBalanceRatio. This will cause the boundary checks to be performed in the wrong direction.

## 7: Improper Rounding of Utility

The _applyFeeByRounding function seems to be attempting to apply a fee by rounding the utility value. However, the logic in this function is not clear, and the calculations are not standard rounding operations. This may lead to unexpected behavior in fee calculation.
