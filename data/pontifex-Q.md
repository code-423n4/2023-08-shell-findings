### L-1 Wrong comments
Mistakes in comments can be misleading.
The comment `amount cannot be less than 0` should be `amount should be less than 0`. There are 3 instances:
```solidity
295:        // amount cannot be less than 0
296:        require(result < 0);


450:        // amount cannot be less than 0
451:        require(result < 0);


487:        // amount cannot be less than 0
488:        require(result < 0);
```

The comment `We use FEE_UP because we want to increase the perceived amount of` should be `We use FEE_DOWN because we want to increase the perceived amount of`.
```solidity
459:     * @dev We use FEE_UP because we want to increase the perceived amount of
...
481:            FEE_DOWN,
```

### L-2 Insufficient comments for magic values.
It is hard to check constant values correctness due to insufficient comments.
```solidity
157:    int128 constant MAX_M = 0x5f5e1000000000000000000;
163:    int128 constant MIN_M = 0x00000000000002af31dc461;
169:    int256 constant MAX_PRICE_VALUE = 1844674407370955161600000000;
175:    int256 constant MIN_PRICE_VALUE = 184467440737;
```
