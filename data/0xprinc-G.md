## 1. Better to use two require statements rather than using `&&` operator

## 2. No need to introduce the return variables that are not processed 
Function `_getPointGivenYandUtility` and `_getPointGivenXandUtility` have the return variables named as `y0` and `x0` respectively. But the value of them is just same as `y` and `x` respectively. So better not to include them as return variable. This will save extra MSTORE, MLOAD, and CALLDATALOAD.

## 3. Better to validate the input before computing the formulas in `_applyFeeByRounding()`

The require statement is given after the computation of the `roundedAbsoluteAmount` in both the cases of `feeUp` values. It will consume irrelevant gas if it computes the value of `roundedAbsoluteAmount` and then fails the require statement. The better version of that can be precalculation of the range of `amount` so that it could be checked before calculation of `roundedAbsoluteAmount`.
