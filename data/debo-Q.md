## [L-01] Block values as a proxy for time

## Impact Description
There are three occurrences of block.timestamp within the EvolvingProteus contract.
In the case of block.timestamp, developers often attempt to use it to trigger time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.

        return block.timestamp - self.t_init;

## Tools Used
Manual Review.

## Remediation
The alternative is to use oracles.
