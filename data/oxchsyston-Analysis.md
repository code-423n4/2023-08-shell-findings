                INTRODUCTION 
The protocol is a pool (evolving Proteus) that can passively update liquidity concentration over time, given a starting liquidity and ending liquidity. the pool creator also gives the starting timestamp and ending timestamp. The primitive can be used in dutch auctions and dynamic AMMs.
                 ANALYSIS
The codebase is well written with in-code comment but still comes off as complex, coupled with it's complex idea. The mechanism is well thought out as ideas in white paper is well implemented in code. I could not spot any system risks.
                 EVALUATION APPROACH
In auditing the codebase, I evaluation the user compatibility and risks therein. Also evaluated possible loss of funds to the protocol.
Learn alot from the protocol as it's ideas were novel.
