## Executive Summary

 Shell protocol is a set of EVM-based smart contracts on Arbitrum One. It is designed to be a modular ecosystem of services that can be easily bundled together and used by users. The protocol's native AMM engine, Proteus, allows users to create custom pools with concentrated liquidity and fungible LP tokens.

This report provides an advanced analysis of the Shell protocol codebase. The analysis covers the following areas:

- Analysis of the codebase (What's unique? What's using existing patterns?)
- Architecture feedback
- Centralization risks
- Systemic risks
- Mechanism review
- Other recommendations
- Conclusion

## Analysis of the codebase

The Shell protocol codebase is well-written and easy to understand. It uses a number of existing patterns, such as the ERC-20 token standard and the Solidity programming language. However, there are also some unique features, such as the Evolving Proteus primitive.

The Evolving Proteus primitive is a new way to update liquidity concentration over time. It is designed to be more efficient than traditional methods, such as liquidity bootstrapping pools.

## Architecture feedback

The overall architecture of the Shell protocol is sound. The core components are well-defined and the interactions between them are clear. However, there are a few areas where the architecture could be improved. For example, the error handling could be more robust and the documentation could be more comprehensive.


## Centralization risks

The following centralization risks are associated with the Shell protocol:

- The liquidity providers (LPs) who stake their tokens in the Proteus pools are exposed to the risk of the pool being drained.
- The Shell DAO, which will govern the protocol, could become centralized if a small number of entities control a majority of the voting power.

## Systemic risks

The following systemic risks are associated with the Shell protocol:

- If a large number of users withdraw their liquidity from the Proteus pools, this could cause the prices of the tokens in the pool to go haywire.
- If there is a bug in the Evolving Proteus primitive, this could lead to losses for LPs.
## Mechanism review

The Evolving Proteus primitive was reviewed and found to be sound. However, it is important to note that the primitive is still under development and there is a risk of bugs.

## Other recommendations

In addition to the above, here are a few other recommendations for the Shell protocol:

- The protocol should be audited by a reputable security firm.
- The protocol should be stress-tested to ensure that it can handle large volumes of transactions.
- The protocol should be regularly updated with new features and bug fixes.
## Conclusion

The Shell protocol is a promising DeFi project with a lot of potential. However, there are a few risks that should be considered before using the protocol. I believe that the risks can be mitigated by taking the recommendations above into account.

I believe  Shell team can make the protocol a safe and reliable option for DeFi users.
