1. There is no need to check if a uint256 is lower than INT_MAX as INT_MAX is the maximum possible value of a uint and if any supplied variable is higher than that would immediately cause the function to revert. This check can be seen on several occasions:

2. If statements can be combined to reduce gas as they check for the same conditions:

3. The `_findFinalPoint` function is only used for redirecting the call to either `_getPointGivenXandUtility` or `_getPointGivenYandUtility`, thus it can be removed in order the reduce the initial contract deployement gas and transaction gas. Threfore it can just be replaced with `_getPointGivenXandUtility` or `_getPointGivenYandUtility` depending on the situation.

4. In `_getUtilityFinalLp` the return declaration is obsolete as `uf` would be either way returned.

5. In `_getUtility` there is an if statement checking if `a` and `b` are both negative but this is not possible to be true as 'a' and `b` are both the product of a square root, which can never return a negative number. It could be removed in order to reduce gas costs.
